## Particulate Matter Deposition (PM₁₀)	

Particulate matter (PM10) is a complex mixture of the following:

* Primary particles, which are emitted directly as a result of combustion processes (e.g. diesel engines and wood-fired heating systems), the abrasion of tyres, brakes and road surfaces, and resuspension;
* Secondary particles, which are formed in the atmosphere from gaseous precursors (sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, ammonia and volatile organic compounds).

PM10 designates particles with a diameter measuring less than 10 thousandths of a millimetre, which can penetrate the finest branches of the bronchial tree and sometimes pass into the lymphatic system and the bloodstream. Effects on human health include : 

* cough, respiratory distress, bronchitis and asthma attacks 
* respiratory and cardiovascular disease, possibly necessitating hospitalization
* lung cancer; and premature deaths (3’700 premature deaths are attributed to atmospheric pollution in Switzerland every year).

Cities and built-up areas close to traffic are still exposed to excessive levels of particulate matter particularly in the winter months. To ensure that the limits currently specified for particulate matter are complied with, current levels of PM10 emissions in Switzerland need to be **reduced by around 50%**, and a similar reduction is required for emissions of precursor gases.

Tree canopies act as natural filters that trap PM10 particles from the air. The leaves and branches of trees can capture and hold onto these particles, helping to remove them from the atmosphere.
