### The  project

The Atlas is an initiative from the Structural Xploration Lab at EPFL for a greater understanding of concrete reuse in construction, both in research and practice.

The project is born from an initial research project on the history of concrete reuse. In this research, we built a database of structural concrete reuse projects in the construction sector. It is presented and analyzed in a paper available here (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.135235). 

In 2024, we decided to transform the database into an interactive atlas to make it more accessible to practitioners and researchers. We will keep updating the database with newly collected projects. To keep the atlas up to date, share your project with us via the “+” button!

### Why reusing concrete?

Concrete is the most used and demolished construction material.

Despite the large environmental degradation caused by the concrete industry, concrete buildings that are still structurally sound are demolished for socio-economic reasons, causing the loss of their embodied carbon, history and technology.

Instead of crushing and downcycling concrete into rubble, techniques exist to deconstruct soon-to-be-demolished concrete structures into large structural elements and to reuse these elements to build new structures. 

Concrete elements can be directly reused in new structures, avoiding the need for fresh cement, sand, or aggregates. Thus, concrete reuse has extremely little environmental impacts compared to conventional concrete construction. Plus, it’s an innovative way to support local economy and prolong the use of material and immaterial resources.

Sharing knowledge on past projects – the driver behind the Atlas project - is essential for a better understanding by the community of the challenges and opportunities of this little-known, circular approach.

### About the Structural Xploration Lab (SXL)

The SXL is a research unit from the Architecture Department at EPFL. At SXL, architects and engineers research sustainable design strategies for the construction industry. With a strong focus on structures and circular construction approaches, we develop design tools and methods and conduct socio-historic studies to advance knowledge in sustainable design.
