## About

### The Urbtrees project

The Urbtrees research project is an original collaboration between three laboratories at EPFL's Natural, Architectural and Built Environment Faculty (ENAC): [PERL](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/perl/) (Plant Ecology Research Laboratory), [EERL](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/eerl/) (Extreme Environments Research Laboratory) and [ALICE](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/alice/) (Atelier de la Conception de l'Espace), aimed at quantifying and mapping the interactions of isolated trees in the canton of Geneva with their environment, from the standpoints of tree physiology, atmospheric chemistry and urban design. 

The overall project is divided into several independent lines of study focusing respectively on the cooling effect of trees (PERL), tree drawing and mapping (ALICE) and the impact of trees on air quality (EERL). This platform presents the results of the air quality study mapped across the Geneva territory.
