# The ARC Project

## The Atlas of Reused Concrete

The Atlas of Reused Concrete is an initiative from the Structural Xploration Lab at EPFL for a greater understanding of concrete reuse in construction, both in research and practice.

The project was born from an initial research project on the history of concrete reuse. In this research, we built a database of structural concrete reuse projects in the construction sector. It is presented and analyzed in a paper available [here](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0959652622048090).

In 2024, we decided to transform the database into an interactive atlas, making knowledge more accessible to practitioners and researchers. We will keep updating the database with newly collected projects. To keep the atlas up to date, **share your project with us** via the **:mdi-plus-box: button!**

## By the wayâ€¦ why reusing concrete?

Concrete is the most demolished construction material in many territories. Every day, concrete buildings that are still structurally sound are demolished for socio-economic reasons, causing the loss of their embodied carbon and history.

Instead of crushing and downcycling concrete into rubble, techniques exist to deconstruct soon-to-be-demolished concrete structures into large structural elements and to reuse these elements to build new structures.

Reusing concrete elements is an innovative way to:
- Support the local economy
- Prolong the use of material and immaterial resources
- Avoid the need for fresh cement, sand, or aggregates

Thus, building with reused concrete has a significantly lower environmental impact compared to conventional concrete construction.

Sharing knowledge on past projects â€“ the driver behind the Atlas project - is essential for a better understanding by the community of the challenges and opportunities of this little-known, circular approach.
