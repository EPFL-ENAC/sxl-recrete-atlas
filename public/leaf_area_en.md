## Total leaf area

Every singular tree total leaf area was computed by i-Tree Eco based on the crown height, average crown diameter, specie-specific average shading factor (i.e., percent light intensity intercepted by foliated tree crowns) and the surface area of the tree crown. The leaf area is used to calculate BVOC emissions, OFP, PM₁₀ and O₃ removal.
