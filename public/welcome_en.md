### Welcome to the Urbtrees platform

This research project studies **the impact of the dominant tree species in the canton of Geneva on air quality** - independently of other interactions with their environment - in order to enrich our knowledge of these fabulous living beings and take a step towards a better understanding of their behavior.

**Trees interact with the atmosphere mainly through their leaves**. The foliage acts as a filter, trapping particles that are harmful to humans. However, when stressed by pollution or drought, trees also emit molecules that are precursors to the formation of ozone, a pollutant that causes respiratory problems.

**The originality of this project is to provide results at species level mapped at cantonal level, based on the cantonal inventory of isolated trees (ICA) in the canton of Geneva**. This approach highlights the diversity and complexity of interactions between trees and their environment, and prevents certain generalizations. 

**The results show that under the current circumstances of pollution and drought in Geneva, the 240,000 trees listed in the ICA can produce more ozone in a year than they filter, and that the contribution to ozone formation depends strongly on the tree species**.

**As ozone formation is closely linked to pollutant emissions from road traffic, the results don’t incriminate the presence of trees in cities**, but show that certain species can enhance ozone formation in stressed urban environments and thus have a negative impact that has been mainly ignored or minimized.

**It is therefore possible to worsen air quality by massively planting species that promote ozone formation**. On the other hand, certain trees can filter out a significant quantity of pollutants and could be encouraged in certain urban contexts or protected in the case of existing ancient trees. Against maximalist solutions, it is an invitation to count on a dendrologist and/or a biologist expertise in large scale plantation projects to take into account these complex issues.

**In conclusion, the artificial planting of trees in urban environments should take into account their numerous effects on the environment and the population**. Otherwise, unexpected negative effects may be inadvertently reinforced. Planting trees blindly does not solve the problem of air pollution, although it can certainly help improve air quality. **In the case of air pollution, it would be more effective to treat the CO2 emissions problem at its source**.

**This study represents a pilot project to assess the positive and negative impacts of trees on air quality at the species level in the canton of Geneva**. The calculations are based on the available public data, which cover around 1⁄4 of existing trees in the canton of Geneva in 2023 and call for more in-depth studies to refine these initial results. 

**This platform enables anyone interested in the issue of urban trees to explore various maps and resources that illustrate the impact of isolated trees in Geneva on air quality over a period of one year**.
