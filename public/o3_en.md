## Ozone Deposition	

Ozone is a gas and is created when an O₂ compound is joined by another oxygen particle, becoming O₃ - a compound of three oxygen particles.

Ground level ozone is a pollutant created by volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides when they react with sunlight (UV rays). At ground level, ozone can have harmful effects on humans and our environment. 
 
The primary sources of VOC and nitrogen oxide emissions are:

* Exhaust from motor vehicles.
* Industrial facilities.
* Power stations.
* Gasoline vapors.
* Some chemical solvents.

Ozone occurs more frequently in sunny and hot days, usually in the afternoon or early evening. High temperatures in summer, spring, and fall are known to contribute to increased levels of ozone at ground level.

Breathing in ozone can lead to a number of health issues, such as asthma. Those most at risk include children, the elderly and those who already have lung diseases. 

Ozone was also linked to approximately one million premature deaths around the world in 2010 by Scientists at the University of York's Stockholm Environment Institute.
