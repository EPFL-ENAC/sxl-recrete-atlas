### Add a new project to the database!

The Atlas is a database of structural concrete reuse projects in the construction sector, initially developed at EPFL in 2022 To maintain a good overview of the currently evolving practice of concrete reuse, we strive to keep it updated with the latest projects. However, we may have missed a project or some information. If this is the case and you think that a new project should be mentioned on this website, please fill in <a href="/New_project_EN.pdf" target="_blank">this form</a> and send it to [concrete-reuse@epfl.ch](mailto:concrete-reuse@epfl.ch). Provide as much information as possible about the proposed projects.

Thank you for contributing to the completeness of the atlas!
