## Ozone Formation Potential

Ozone formation potential (OFP) estimates the contribution of individual VOC species to ozone formation and is determined based on the maximum incremental reactivity (MIR) scale. 

Ozone formation potential (OFP) is a parameter that has been widely used to describe the role of individual VOCs in tropospheric ozone formation.
