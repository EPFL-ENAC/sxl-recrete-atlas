## The concept of concrete reuse

### What is concrete reuse?
Concrete reuse consists of carefully deconstructing about-to-be-demolished concrete structures into elements, and reusing these elements, as is, after no or minor modifications, assembling them into new structures. 
Concrete reuse prolongs the use of existing resources and saves the embodied carbon, history and technology of the salvaged components.

### What is reinforced concrete? 
_A convenient material_ - Concrete is a composite material: it is made of aggregates (sand and small stones) bounded together by cement reacted with water. Concrete is poured over steel reinforcement bars, and this reinforced concrete resists well to tensile and compressive stresses. It has good fire-resisting properties and can adapt to various shapes and uses at relatively low costs.

_A ubiquitous material_ - Concrete is the most used and discarded construction material on the planet. In Europe, half of the mass of all buildings built after 1949 is concrete! This demand causes large detrimental environmental impacts, mainly climate change and natural resource consumption. The production of cement causes 8-9% of all global greenhouse gas emissions. These emissions are mainly caused by the production of clinker – its main ingredient – of which the production relies on a chemical reaction (limestone decarbonation or clinkerisation) that releases CO2 and that must be triggered by heat, which production also emits CO2.

_A too-often discarded material_ - Because of socio-economic reasons, buildings that are still structurally sound are often demolished. This generates large volumes of discarded concrete, the largest construction-material waste stream in most territories. Avoiding premature demolitions should always be a priority, but when unavoidable, discarded concrete should be valued at best. Reusing concrete elements rather than crushing them into rubble prolongs the use of existing resources and reduces the need for fresh concrete and cement (see next question).

### Why is concrete reuse different from concrete recycling?
Despite misleading confusion, concrete reuse is very different from concrete recycling.
Reused concrete elements are carefully extracted from structures and reused nearly as is to build new structures. This method avoids the production of new cement and the extraction of sand or stone aggregates.
Today, most structures are not carefully deconstructed but crushed down into rubble. This concrete rubble is possibly recycled as aggregates into “recycled concrete mixes”. In these “recycled concrete mixes”, recycled aggregates replace a share of natural aggregates, but new sand, water, and cement must be added as in standard new concrete mixes. Recycled concrete thus leads only to a partial reduction of natural-resource use and to, on average, no benefits in terms of carbon footprint compared to new concrete mixes.

### Is concrete reuse a new approach?
Concrete reuse is not new to architecture! Examples of concrete being reused as structural elements have been identified from the late 1960s in Germany and the 1980s in the Netherlands and Sweden, to name just a few countries. Overall, concrete elements have been structurally reused in more than 50 built projects since the late 1960s. Find more details on the history of concrete reuse in our scientific articles [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.135235) and [there](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/311829?v=pdf).

 
## Structural design with reused concrete

### How can I reuse reinforced concrete?
Various methods and techniques to reuse concrete exist. We identified five main approaches to reusing concrete. A critical analysis of the state of practice and research of these five approaches is provided in [this paper](http://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/2600/19/192006). To summarize the five approaches, three of them reuse elements carefully deconstructed from disused structures, and they reuse:
* **Blocks in compression**, like in the [Re:Crete arch footbridge](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.istruc.2022.07.012). This approach partly downcycled reinforced concrete as only its compressive strength is used in the new design.
* **Longer flat elements for (nearly) equivalent reuse**, like in the reuse of [slabs as slabs](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.141566). This approach reuses both the compressive and tensile strength of reinforced concrete.
* **3D assemblies**, like in the [rebuiLT pavilion](http://doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/1363/1/012052). This approach maintains the continuous connections between vertical and horizontal elements.

Two of them reuse concrete debris generated by demolition activities:
* **Flat debris**, like in [the walls made of reused rubble](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/311046?v=pdf) and developed at EPFL.
* **Irregular debris**, often in landscaping applications.

### Can I reuse any concrete?
The new use of the salvaged reinforced concrete elements must be adapted to the quality and condition of the pieces. Concrete that has been exposed to deicing salts or weathering is likely to be more damaged than well-protected concrete inside buildings. For more info, you can also check the reusability grading system developed at EPFL [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2024.108584). Both the European ReCreate and the Danish StructuralReuse research projects also recently published first versions of procedures to assess existing precast concrete elements prior to their deconstruction and reuse while in Norway, a standard has been released for specifically to assess the reuse of hollow-core slabs (see section on related projects). 


### Is there any design guidelines for reused concrete?
No Eurocode on concrete reuse yet exists. In Switzerland, designs are made by combining standards for new-and existing concrete structures. At EPFL, we developed a method for the preliminary design of slab systems reusing concrete, available [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.141566), with some more details [here](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/310341?v=pdf). The study is bounded to preliminary design. 

### What are the environmental benefits?
Reusing concrete elements reduces new resource consumption and new product manufacturing. Various studies have confirmed the potential large environmental-impact reductions of reusing concrete compared to new concrete production. For example, embodied carbon is reduced by up to 63 % for the Re:Crete arch footbridge and in average by 80 % for load-bearing floor systems developed at EPFL, compared to conventional traditional new concrete designs. These significant reductions are explained by the fact that, in new designs, the production of cement – which is avoided when concrete is reused – account for 70 % of the embodied carbon of a cubic meter of concrete. The Atlas includes the environmental-analysis data of built precedents when available (use our filter).

 
## Technical questions

### How to know the properties of concrete before reusing it?
Non-destructive and destructive testing methods are available to assess the properties of reinforced concrete. Many of these techniques have been used for a long time in the field of existing structures. A reusability assessment protocol was recently developed at EPFL - read the full paper on it [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2024.108584).

### What are the techniques for salvaging reinforced concrete elements?
Concrete elements are typically extracted from soon-to-be demolished structures using circular saws. Alternative separating techniques are also possible (hydro-jetting, ribbon cutting). Once cut, the elements can be lifted with a crane. Smaller elements can be extracted on a carrier. Before deconstruction operations start, the donor structure is generally shored up with props to ensure its structural stability during deconstruction. You can find illustrations of the approach in our papers on our built prototypes, the [Re:Crete arch footbridge](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.istruc.2022.07.012), the [rebuiLT pavilion](http://doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/1363/1/012052), and the ultra-low-carbon [load-bearing floor systems](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.141566) and the corresponding [FLO:RE mock-up](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/310341?v=pdf).

### How to store reused concrete elements?
During storage, concrete elements can be piled up, using support spacers between the elements to allow the evacuation of any humidity. These support spacers should be aligned between the different levels and any anchor points should remain accessible. The number of elements stacked on top of each other depends on the lifting capacity on the storage site.
In case of prolonged storage, the storage area should be covered, or the degradation risks of the cut concrete should be assessed. 

### Can I buy reused concrete?
Today, no network of concrete-element resellers is known to exist. However, companies needed to conduct concrete extraction work exist. The actors to involve in such operations are, among others, civil engineers - who will assess the reuse potential and process, shoring-up companies, concrete-sawing companies, transportation companies and possibly a storage company. Special amendments in contracts must be defined to agree on work quality and responsibility schemes.

### How to reassemble/reconnect reusable concrete elements?
Various techniques exist to reassemble and, if necessary, reconnect concrete elements (as reviewed in [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.135235) – see Section 5.2). Bending-resisting connections can recreate the structural continuity between the elements, like the solutions drafted in [this article](https://doi.org/10.1201/9781003323020-18), and simpler connections will only transfer vertical and lateral loads as the one used in the [FLO:RE mock-up](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/310341?v=pdf).
