93,"In Appingedam, a temporary access bridge (Oling 5) had to be constructed. In the same period, the KW21 Europaplein viaduct in Groningen which was built between 1985-1986 was being replaced. The deck of this viaduct was constructed from prefabricated prestressed inverted T-girders with a compression layer. Instead of grinding the girders into rubble, the girders were given a second life at a different destination. Seven of these girders were used to construct the new temporary bridge. The old compression layer was removed so that the original T-girder was obtained again. A newly cast in-situ concrete compression layer was applied on top of these reused girders so that one bridge deck was obtained again. In this way, the 40 years old girders weren’t reused as rubble as a road foundation, but were reused in a high-quality manner for their original function. The girders meet the design requirements of new construction conform the Eurocode. The aim is that the temporary residential area will no longer be needed after 15 years and that the bridge will then be dismantled again.", Oling 5 Bridge in Appingedam,"""PC""",,NL,Appingedam,"""53.3133385,6.84437110""",,25,,,2022,,37,,,7,pieces,0,,infrastructure,"""beam""",0,,,,infrastructure,"""beam""",,"""Vergoossen et al. 2021, Vergoossen et al. 2022""",,,,,,,,,Danny Jilissen,1,,,"""93_01_royalhastignendvh.jpg""","""© Royal HaskoningDVH""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
